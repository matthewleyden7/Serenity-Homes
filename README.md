Serenity Homes is a medium-skill machine learning project that determine the price of a new home in the Seattle area based on a number of factors using real world data.

Problem Statement:
  One of the difficulties for any real estate business is determining the market value for a home. Market value is what an informed and willing buyer will pay for a home. Many companies will use rough estimates of what a house is worth based on manual analysis of past sales of comparable houses. These are based on numerous factors including size, age, location, and features including comparable homes with similar amenities and level of finishes and updates.
Most real estate companies will hire residential home estimators to perform this work. These are professionals that are knowledgeable about residential construction and how to determine the price of a home. Not only do these professionals carry a substantial yearly cost to a company, they may take weeks to consider all of the factors before calculating a final estimate. The employer would likely accrue travel expenses as well. In addition, human error is always a possibility.

  Our proposed solution is to develop an application that uses machine learning to determine a home’s market value. This would instantly analyze past trends to develop a reliable figure. The application would evaluate the most important elements of a home’s value such as square footage, exact location, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, whether the home is by the water, etc. Using this application, a company will be able to determine with a high degree of accuracy exactly how much a home is worth. Because the data used to train a model is based on previous real sales, this generated price is likely to be attractive to buyers. The application will be informative to any real estate company and will save on the additional expenses that would be required to employ professionals to do the same work. It would also ensure the house gets on the market as soon as possible which means faster revenue generation.
